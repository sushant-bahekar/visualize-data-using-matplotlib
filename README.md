 Indian Election Analysis
India's lower house of Parliament,the Lok Sabha, has 543 seats in total.Members of Lok Sabha (House of the People) or the lower house of India's Parliament are elected by being voted upon by all adult citizens of India, from a set of candidates who stand in their respective constituencies. Every adult citizen of India can vote only in their constituency. Candidates who win the Lok Sabha elections are called 'Member of Parliament' and hold their seats for five years or until the body is dissolved by the President on the advice of the council of ministers.

There are more than 700 million voters with more than 800,000 polling stations.

The Lok Sabha election is a very complex affair as it involves a lot of factors. It is this very fact that makes it a perfect topic to analyze.

Currently there are two major parties in India, Bhartiya Janta Party(BJP) and Indian National Congress(INC).

As India is country of diversities, and each region is very different from every other region, there are a lot of regional or state parties having major influences. These parties can either support any of the alliance to make a government or can stay independent.

There are two major alliances, the NDA led by BJP and the UPA led by INC.
